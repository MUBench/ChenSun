Right now the main method in protocol is receiving strings from the client.
Everytime it receives a string, it passes it to processInput(). 

OK, what are the results that could be handed after processing the input?
a string gets printed out on the client's screen. (starts with print)
passing a command to client to change something.
passing a command to get something back.
right now, one line per "command"
Is there ways to pass back multiple lines?

---------------LOGIN-----------------------------
client says: Login or register
user says: login user1
client gives to protocol: login user1
protocol processes command "login":
	checks username against database.
	If name exist, passback command "setLoggedIn true; setUser user1"
	if name not exist, passback command "setLoggedIn false"
