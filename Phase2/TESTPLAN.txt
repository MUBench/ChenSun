General testing:
- tested to make sure the commands corresponds to the functions they're suppose to 
perform.
- multiple clients can run at the same time
- Only registration and login commands work when a user is not logged in.

registeration:
- tested registering a member. It is successfully inserted into the database as a 
registration request.
- tested registering a username that already exist, or is pending registration.
- typing cancel in the middle of registration cancels the registration protocol.

login:
- "login user" will set user as the user of the current session
- After logging in, the information displayed is accurate (username, a cappella 
group, and role) and displayed correctly
- Tested that if there are requests, then the corresponding "pending requests" 
messages show up with the correct count of registration per catagory

Registration Requests:
- if someone registers for a group, all admins and super admins (SA) for the group 
sees the registration requests and are able to approve it.
- Once an admin approves the user, all existing members in the a cappella become 
friends with the new user.
- If an admin approves multiple users at the same time, they become friends with 
each other and with existing group members
- Once an admin approves the user, the registration request record gets deleted 
from the database.
- insertion into users table and addition of friends relationships happen as one
transaction

addFriend
- typing the command shows a complete list of users in the system who are not 
currently friends with the current user and whose friendship has not been requested.
- The information for each user displayed is correct (the right a cappella group)
- typing the command with an argument (like addFriend c) shows a list of users 
with usernames starting with the argument (case insensitive)
- upon completion of the protocol, a friend request from the current user to the
specified user shows up in the database correctly.
- a friend request from user2 cannot be sent to user1 if user1 already requested
user2 as friend

friendRequests
- when user1 requests user2 as friend, the request shows up when user2 logs in.
- when user1 approves a friend request from user2, the corresponding friend 
request gets deleted from the database, and friend tuple gets inserted into the
database at the same time as a transaction

deleteUser
- a list with only users from user1's group shows up when user1 (SA) tries to 
delete a user.
- when a user is deleted, any friend requests, friends relations involving the
use is also deleted

showFriends
- only people the user has friended and approved shows up in the showFriends list.
- if a friend tuple is removed, it is reflected in the showFriends list

changeUserRole
- a list with only users from user1's group shows up when user1 (SA) tries to
change a user's role
- it is not possible to change anyone's role to SA within this function

transferSA
- only admins from user1's group shows up when user1 (SA) types in "transferSA"
- when user1 transfers SA role to user2, user1's role changes to admin and user2's
role changes to SA in one transaction
