Goal of Protocol:
	Authentication of server and client:
		At the end of the protocol, the client knows that the server 
		it is communicating to has the private key that corresponds 
		to the public key that the client is holding. Server also
		gets a weak authentication of the client because the 
		client knows how to answer the challenge sent to him.
		There is no guarantee that the client is a genuine client.
		

Authentication Protocol:
	1) Ensure that the ClientGUI is talking to the 
	genuine server.
	2) Ensure that the server is talking to a genuine
	ClientGUI.
	3) Ensure that ClientGUI and server communications
	are confidential.
	4) Ensure that the user operating the ClientGUI is
	a genuine user of the system.
	5) Ensure that the server's long term storage data
	is confidential.
	
Set-Up Assumptions
	1) The server has a public key known to all ClientGUI's
	and a private key that only its operator knows.
	2) The operator has a shared key only the operator knows,
	which is used to encrypt/decrypt the database
	(Enrollment Protocol)
	3) Presidents/The-Most-High of ACapella groups have contacted
	the server operator to set up their own accounts as well
	as their own ACapella groups.
